var GameThronesTimeline = {

"-20,000":"Before the coming of men: The lands of Westeros are inhabited by a mysterious race of diminutive humanoid creatures known as the children of the forest, giants and other magical creatures.",
"-12,000":"The First Men invade Westeros: A human ethnic group, the First Men, invades Westeros across the land-bridge from Essos, bearing weapons of bronze. In a futile attempt to end the invasion, the children use magic to shatter that land-bridge, creating the island chain known as the Stepstones. However, the First Men are able to reinforce by ship, leading to generations of warfare over the land. The First Men are more numerous, larger, stronger, and more technologically advanced than the children, who try to resist the invaders using their magic. It proves unsuccessful, however: the First Men gradually push deeper and deeper into Westeros, establishing hundreds of petty kingdoms.",
"-10,000":"Signing of the Pact: After years of warfare, the First Men and children of the forest come to a standstill and finally agree to a peaceful coexistence, signing the pact of The Isle of Faces. This pact gives the First Men dominion over the open lands and lets the children keep control over the forested areas. In time, the First Men adopt the worship of the Old Gods of the Forest.",
"-10,000":"Age of Heroes: An era during the history of Westeros, which would be named so later for the great men and women who live in the years of peace and prosperity following the forging of the Pact. The Pact endures for nearly four thousand years, and in that time, the children of the forest and the First Men grow closer. In time, the First Men set aside many of their cultural differences to embrace the ways and customs of the children of the forest. With the exception of the Drowned God of the Iron Islands and the Lady of the Waves and Lord of the Skies of the Three Sisters, the gods of the children become those of the First Men. Many of the noble houses of Westeros today trace their lineage back to the Age of Heroes. This was the time when grand historical figures are said to have lived, such as Brandon the Builder, founder of House Stark; Lann the Clever, who winkled Casterly Rock from the Casterlys, founder of House Lannister; or Garth Greenhand, founder of House Gardener of the Reach. Also during this era the Storm Kings arise in the stormlands: a line with figures such as the founding Durran, supposed builder of Storm's End, first king of the Iron Islands; and the Grey King.",
"-8,000":"The Long Night: In this time, night seems to last for a generation, and the longest, coldest and darkest winter descends on Westeros. The ice spreads down from the north, and under the cover of darkness, the Others invade Westeros from the uttermost north, marching, killing and raising up the dead to be their servants in unlife and nearly destroying all men in Westeros. The Long Night comes to an end with the Battle for the Dawn. The children and the First Men unite to defeat the Others with dragonglass weapons, with the Night's Watch pushing them back into the frozen reaches of the Far North.[1] Legendary figures from this time include the last hero and Azor Ahai, who wields a great sword of fire, Lightbringer. Founding of the Wall: With the Others defeated, Bran the Builder, with the aid of giants, the First Men, and perhaps the children of the forest, raises the Wall: a monumental fortification of ice and ancient magic, to shelter the realms of men from the menaces of the north. The Sworn Brotherhood of the Night's Watch guards the Wall. It is said that Bran the Builder also built Winterfell, became the first King in the North, and founded House Stark. The Night's King: Not long after the Wall is complete, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch betrays his oath. He is seduced by a wight woman from beyond the Wall: declares himself the Night's King and rises in rebellion with the Watch as his personal army. During the dark years of his reign, horrific atrocities are committed, of which tales would be told in the North even after several millenia. The Starks of Winterfell and the King-beyond-the-Wall, Joramun, join forces to defeat the Night's King and thus restore honor to the Watch. This is the same Joramun who also finds the Horn of Winter, which he is said to use to awaken giants from the earth.",
"-6,000":"Foundation of the Faith: In the hills of Andalos on the eastern continent, Essos, a new religion takes shape, called the Faith of the Seven. Supposedly, the supreme deity of the Andals appears to them, guiding them into their invasion of Westeros. The Andal Invasion: The Andals cross the narrow sea and make landfall on its eastern shore at the Fingers, on what would one day become the Vale of Arryn. They come under the banner of the Faith of the Seven, with seven-pointed stars carved into their chests, wielding weapons of steel. They fight both the First Men and the children of the forest, sweeping the land much like the First Men did thousands of years before. When the Andals crossed the narrow sea from Essos is disputed; some sources indicate six thousand years ago,[2] the True History states it was four thousand years ago, and some maesters claim it was two thousand years ago.[3] For centuries the Andals war with the First Men and the children in an attempt to drive them out. One by one, the six southron kingdoms fall and the weirwoods are burned. Only the Kingdom of the North remains under the rule of the First Men, in large part due to the strategically located fortress of Moat Cailin resisting multiple attempts to take it and thereafter serving as the door between North and South. Even though the North remain secure, the children of the forest begin their slow withdrawal from the lands of men, retreating deeper into their forests and north of the Wall.",
"-4,000":"The Iron Islands fall to the Andals, ending the first line of kings ruling there uncontested for over a thousand years, originating from Urron Redhand. Unlike in the other regions, however, Andals are assimilated to the native beliefs of the Old Way and the Drowned God.",
"-5,000":"Rise of the Valyrian Freehold: On the eastern continent, the peaceful sheep-herding folk of the Valyrian peninsula find dragons lairing in the Fourteen Fires, an immense chain of volcanoes extending across the neck of the peninsula. The Valyrians tame the dragons with magic, which gives them the means to gain influence over the area. The Valyrian Freehold is established. In its capital, Valyria, magic flourishes, topless towers rise toward the heavens where dragons soar, stone sphinxes gaze down through eyes of garnet, and smiths forge swords of legendary strength and sharpness. Conquest of Ghiscar: Five great wars are fought between the Ghiscari Empire, the greatest empire on the eastern peninsula, and the Freehold â€” wars which Valyria wins with the help of its dragons. After the last war, the Freehold utterly destroys the Ghiscari capital, slaying its people, destroying the city's walls and streets with dragonflame, and salting and sulphuring the fields. The Ghiscari empire shattered, the Valyrian Freehold expands its influence over the surviving Ghiscari cities of Slaver's Bay.",
"-700":"The Rhoynar migration: With the destruction of Old Ghis, the Freehold's slow westward expansion brings it into conflict with the Rhoynish cities along the great River Rhoyne, a vast waterway. Prince Garin the Great raises an army a quarter-million strong to oppose the Valyrians, but fails utterly against their dragons. Rhoynar evacuation: Nymeria, a Rhoynish warrior-queen, evacuates the survivors of Garin's war, mostly women and children, on ten thousand ships across the narrow sea, seeking refuge in Dorne, in southern Westeros. There, Nymeria forms a marriage alliance with Lord Mors Martell and together they finally organize the land into one kingdom, establishing House Martell as the ruling house of Dorne. Mors adopts many Rhoynish customs. The unification of Dorne under Nymeria and Mors leads to new conflicts with the kingdoms of the Reach and the Stormlands, expressed through raids, skirmishes, and the occasional wars over the centuries.",
"-500":"The Valyrian Freehold conquers much of what would be the area of the southern Free Cities. A religious sect, the Moonsingers, leads many thousand refugees north to a remote lagoon protected by mountains and mists, and there found the Secret City of Braavos. They later build the Titan of Braavos, a great statue which also serves as a defensive fortification.",
"-200":"The Valyrian Freehold annexes a small island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, off the east coast of Westeros. The Targaryens, a Valyrian noble family, take control of the island building a castle whose tower is shaped to look like dragons, giving its name: Dragonstone.",
"-100":"The Doom of Valyria: The nature of the Doom is unclear, save that heavy volcanic activity is involved, likely due to the Fourteen Fires, the mountains where the dragons were first discovered. The Valyrian Peninsula is shattered and the city of Valyria is laid waste, although not completely destroyed. The dragons of Valyria are virtually wiped out and the Valyrian Freehold crumbled apart, its various city states broke apart asserting their independence, surviving to this day as the Free Cities and the cities of Slaver's Bay. Braavos reveals itself to the other cities, eventually becoming the most powerful of them through its vast fleet and economic power. The cities of Slaver's Bay become independent again, although Ghiscari power begins building again in the south. The warrior-nomads of the vast eastern plains become more emboldened by the fall of Valyria, and their dominant tribe, the Dothraki, begins raiding the surrounding lands. The Targaryens remain safe on Dragonstone, the guardians of possibly the last three dragons in the western world.",
"-3000":"Over the centuries following the Andal Invasion, the southern kingdoms of the first men fall, and eventually the Andals raise up six powerful kingdoms of their own.",
"-3000":"Wildling Invasion: The free folk (wildlings) unite under the brother Kings-beyond-the-Wall, Gendel and Gorne. They manage to evade the Night's Watch and bypass the Wall in great numbers using a network of tunnels that extend under the Wall. However, they are met by the Stark king on the other side and are eventually thrown back.",
"-700":"House Stark finally subdues House Bolton, their primary antagonists for dominance in the North. Later Karlon Stark would defeat sea raiders from the east and found the cadet branch House Karstark. In the West, the Ironborn of the Iron Islands rise to power, at their peak they controll most of the western coast from Oldtown and the Arbor in the south to Bear Island in the North. The Rhoynar fleeing the Valyrians migrate to Dorne. This is the last major migration into Westeros.",
"-350":"The Storm Kings expand their control of the Stormlands north to include the territory of the Riverlands up to the Neck. Over time the ironborn lose many of their possessions but, some three generations before Aegon's Landing, conquer the territory of the Riverlands from the Stormlands. An ironborn king, Harren Hoare, builds Harrenhal.",
"-2-1":"The War of Conquest: Aegon the Conqueror invades Westeros and in two years time subdues, and unites six of the seven kingdoms of Westeros under his banner and constructs a new capital city at King's Landing. He is unable to conquer Dorne and allows it to remain sovereign. With the destruction of the Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, and the death of the last King of the Reach, control of the castle of Storm's End passes to Aegon's bastard half-brother Orys Baratheon, and of Highgarden to Harlen Tyrell. Edmyn Tully of Riverrun is named Lord of the Riverlands and Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke becomes Lord of the Iron Islands. The day of Aegon's coronation by the High Septon in Oldtown becomes the first day of Aegon's reign, beginnning 1AC.",
"37-48":"The Faith Militant uprising: Upon Aegon's death, his son Aenys I, born of incest, takes the throne. The Faith of the Seven rejects his legitimacy to rule and leads a popular uprising against the Targaryens. The weak and indecisive Aenys makes his half-brother Maegor the Hand of the King and gives him authority to deal with the crisis. Maegor's response is ruthless and brutal, resulting in the deaths of thousands in battle, slaughter and by dragonfire. The slaughter lasts all of Aenys' reign and Maegor's, who succeeded him.",
"48":"Jaehaerys the Conciliator: King Jaehaerys I succeeds King Maegor, who by that time is known as Maegor the Cruel. He declares a truce and agrees to end the slaughter in return for the Faith Militant disbanding and submitting to the Targaryens, earning the name The Conciliator. Jaehaerys' rule brings decades of peace and prosperity to the realm.",
"129-131":"The Dance of the Dragons: The first major civil war in the history of the Seven Kingdoms, in 129-131AC: a war of succession between Aegon II and his half-sister Rhaenyra Targaryen over their father's throne. It consumes them both, as well as most of the Targaryen family and their remaining dragons. The war ends with Aegon III, son of Rhaenyra, being crowned.",
"131-157":"Death of the last dragon: King Aegon Targaryen struggles to breed healthy dragons - those he does manage to produce are born weak and sickly. He is unable to prevent the death of the last one, earning himself the title 'Dragonbane'. The last dragons leave behind several eggs which the Targaryens fail to hatch. These eggs are later destroyed or lost, leaving the dragons to be believed extinct.",
"157-161":"Daeron conquers Dorne: Upon taking the throne, at age fourteen, King Daeron I decides to finish Aegon the Conqueror's work and launches a successful invasion of Dorne. Unfortunately, he leaves a Tyrell of Highgarden in charge: a house that has warred with the Martells for thousands of years. The tyrannical rule of the Tyrells triggers an uprising against the Iron Throne. When Daeron I returns with a fresh army, he is killed, his cousin Prince Aemon the Dragonknight is captured and his forty thousand men are lost.",
"161-171":"Reign of King Baelor the Blessed, the septon king. Baelor manages to forge a peace treaty with Dorne. It is said that he made this peace by walking the Boneway barefoot and rescuing his cousin, Aemon the Dragonknight, from a viper pit. He builds the Great Sept in King's Landing, which is later renamed the Great Sept of Baelor. Baelor locks his sisters in the Maidenvault of the Red Keep so the sight of them will not tempt him to carnal thoughts. Despite this, his sister Daena the Defiant has an affair with her cousin Aegon (later Aegon IV) and gives birth to a bastard son, Daemon Blackfyre.",
"170":"Prince Daeron, second cousin of Baelor I, and Princess Myriah Martell of Dorne are married and have their first son, Prince Baelor.",
"171-172":"Reign of King Viserys II.",
"172-184":"Reign of King Aegon IV, Aegon the Unworthy, held to be the worst king in the history of Westeros. On his deathbed Aegon IV legitimises all his bastards, including his 'Great Bastards': Daemon Blackfyre, Aegor Rivers, Brynden Rivers and Shiera Seastar. He is succeeded by his son, Daeron II, but his legitimacy is called into question due to his mother's close relationship with Aemon the Dragonknight.",
"184-209":"Reign of Daeron II.",
"195-196":"The Blackfyre Rebellion: The second major civil war erupts after Daemon Blackfyre puts a claim on the Iron Throne based on Daeron II's illegitimacy.

"259":"The Tragedy of Summerhall: King Aegon V and his heir, Prince Duncan, are killed in a great fire at the Targaryen's summer palace.

Later they conclude the prince is actually Rhaegar's baby son, Aegon.",
"281":"The Year of False Spring: Lord Whent holds a great Tourney at Harrenhal, where Prince Rhaegar distinguishes himself in battle, but names Lyanna Stark of Winterfell, who is betrothed to Robert Baratheon, as the Queen of Love and Beauty rather than his own wife Elia.

The band of outlaws called the Kingswood Brotherhood is defeated by a royal force commanded by Arthur Dayne; during that battle a young squire, Jaime Lannister, distinguishes himself and is knighted, later he becomes a member of the Kingsguard and is disinherited from his father. Tywin Lannister resigns the Handship in angry protest and returns to Casterly Rock.",
"282-283":"Robert's Rebellion: Rhaegar Targaryen abducts Lyanna Stark. Lyanna's brother and father demand that Aerys discipline his son, but instead the Mad King kills them both. Aerys demands the heads of Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark from their ward, Jon Arryn. Instead, Houses Arryn, Stark, and Baratheon raise the standard of rebellion.
